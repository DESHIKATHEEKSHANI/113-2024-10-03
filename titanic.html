          The R.M.S. Titanic is perhaps the most famous shipwreck in our current
          popular culture. Titanic was a British-registered ship in the White
          Star line that was owned by a U.S. company in which famed American
          financier John Pierpont "JP" Morgan was a major stockholder. Titanic
          was built in Belfast, Northern Ireland by Harland & Wolff for
          transatlantic passage between Southampton, England and New York City.
          It was the largest and most luxurious passenger ship of its time and
          was reported to be unsinkable. Titanic, launched on May 31, 1911, and
          set sail on its maiden voyage from Southampton on April 10, 1912, with
          2,240 passengers and crew on board. On April 15, 1912, after striking
          an iceberg, Titanic broke apart and sank to the bottom of the ocean,
          taking with it the lives of more than 1,500 passengers and crew.

          While there has been some salvage outside of the major hull portions,
          most of the ship remains in its final resting place, 12,000 feet below
          sea level and over 350 nautical miles off the coast of Newfoundland,
          Canada. Its famous story of disaster and human drama has been and
          continues to be recounted in numerous books, articles, and movies.
          Titanic has been recognized by the United States Congress for its
          national and international significance and, in many ways, has become
          a cultural icon. The disaster also resulted in a number of memorials
          around the world. In the United States, there are major memorials in
          Washington D.C.offsite link and New Yorkoffsite link; the Widener
          Library offsite linkat Harvard University is another major memorial
          commemorating Henry Elkins Widener, a victim of the sinking.
